            # then return the VALUE of that KEY in the rateDict
            # 2 problems
            # 1) If the period is the same as the period change, this will NOT work because Python is searching FORWARD
            # 2) There should be a maximum upper bound to the period - the term of the loan
            # => we'll have to 1)search backward 2)argument validation, setting the upper bound for the argument

            # Find the index of the passed-in period in the list, then return the key that is
            # IMMEDIATELY LOWER than the period
            # Ex: timeline of 0 --> 180. Reverse list is [180, 0]. If 360 is passed in, list becomes [360, 180, 0]
            # The line below will then return 0+1 = 1st index, aka the rate for 180

            # then return the VALUE of that KEY in the rateDict, and that will be our rate for that period!

        # NOTE: argument validation:
        # The most Pythonic idiom is to clearly document what the function expects
        # and then just try to use whatever gets passed to your function
        # and either LET EXCEPTIONS PROPAGATE or just catch attribute errors and raise a TypeError instead
        # Type-checking should be avoided as much as possible as it goes against duck-typing.
        # Value testing can be OK â€“ depending on the context.
